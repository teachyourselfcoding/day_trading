  "raw_response": "Based on the provided data and analysis, here is the suggested response:\n\n- Pattern Identified: Uptrend\n- Pattern Confidence: High\n- Suggested Action: Buy\n- Entry Price: 213.38, justified by the identified support level in the established uptrend. An alternative entry could be at 213.13.\n- Stop Loss: 212.4, placed below the support level to limit potential losses.\n- Take Profit: 217.97, set at the identified resistance level to secure profits.\n- Risk Reward Ratio: 1:4.7, calculated based on the difference between the entry price and the stop loss and take profit levels.\n- Reasoning: The analysis shows a bullish bias with SMA 20 above SMA 50 (Golden Cross), MACD above the signal line, RSI in a healthy uptrend range, and increasing volume in the uptrend. These factors suggest a high probability of the price continuing to rise.\n- Alternative Scenario: A bearish turn could occur if the MACD crosses below the signal line. However, this scenario is considered to have a low probability.\n- Timeframe: The expected holding period is between 5 to 20 days, in line with the medium-term trading style.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the current market conditions and could change with new data. Always consider your risk tolerance and investment objectives before making trading decisions.",
