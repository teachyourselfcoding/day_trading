The key technical indicators that influenced my decision were the SMA 20, SMA 50, and MACD, all of which showed bullish signals. The RSI is in neutral territory, suggesting the price is not overbought, and the volume trend is increasing, indicating strong buying interest. \n\nI chose an entry price of 198.00, slightly above the current price, to confirm the continuation of the uptrend. The stop loss is set at 196.00, just below the identified support level, to limit potential losses in case of a trend reversal. The take profit target is set at 201.00, near the high of the period, providing a favorable risk-reward ratio of 1.5. \n\nHowever, a break below the support level of 196.04 could invalidate this analysis, indicating a potential trend reversal.",
