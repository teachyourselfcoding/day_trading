  "reasoning": "The META price is in an uptrend with 3 bullish and 0 bearish signals. The MACD is above the signal line, indicating bullish momentum. The RSI is in neutral territory, suggesting there is room for the price to move higher before becoming overbought. The volume trend is increasing, which could indicate growing interest in the stock. The price is currently at the lower end of the Bollinger Bands, which could indicate a potential upward swing.",
  "alternative_scenario": "A break below the support level of 604.34 could invalidate this analysis and suggest a bearish trend.",
