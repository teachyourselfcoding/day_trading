  "raw_response": "Based on the provided data and analysis, here is the suggested response:\n\n- Pattern Identified: Uptrend\n- Pattern Confidence: High\n- Suggested Action: Buy\n- Entry Price: 382.52, justified by the identified support level in the established uptrend. An alternative entry could be at 388.18.\n- Stop Loss: 381.73, placed below the support level to limit potential losses.\n- Take Profit: 384.1, identified as a resistance level where profit can be taken.\n- Risk Reward Ratio: 1:2.0, calculated based on the entry, stop loss, and take profit levels.\n- Reasoning: The MSFT price is in a strong uptrend with multiple bullish signals including the price being above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, MACD above the signal line, and increasing volume. The RSI is in a healthy range indicating the uptrend is not overbought. \n- Alternative Scenario: A bearish scenario could occur if the price breaks below the 382.34 support level or if the MACD crosses below the signal line. However, this scenario is considered to have a low probability.\n- Timeframe: The expected holding period is between 5 to 20 days, in line with the medium-term trading style. \n\nPlease note that while the analysis shows a high confidence in the bullish scenario, it's important to monitor the key triggers and invalidation points for risk management.",
