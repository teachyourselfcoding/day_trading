  "reasoning": "The price of AMZN is in an uptrend with bullish signals from the SMA 20, SMA 50, and MACD. The RSI is in neutral territory, suggesting there is room for the price to move higher. The volume trend is increasing, which supports the upward price movement. The risk-reward ratio is favorable, with a stop loss at the identified support level and a take profit at the high of the period.",
  "alternative_scenario": "A break below the support level of 196.04 could invalidate this analysis and suggest a bearish reversal.",
